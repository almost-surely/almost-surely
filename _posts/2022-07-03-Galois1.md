In the last few weeks I was learning and reading about field theory. Despite of its abstraction and dry technicalities, I realized that it was crucial in solving some interesting mysteries in Geometry. Have you ever wondered how we can trisect an angle, square a circle or double a cube only using an unmarked ruler and a compass? I doubt that anyone would think of any of this but the Greek did and never figured it out. It was not until the nineteenth century that we solved these puzzles due to the advent of field theory. That is almost over 2000 years of wondering whether it is possible to solve any of these puzzles. So they are not as easy as you might think. In this three-part article, I will show you how field theory helped settling these mysteries. In the first two parts I will explain the theoretical aspects needed to understand the solution, which you will be introduced to in the last part so bear with me. And to my academic and mathematician friends, I am saying hello! And, please, don't get offended!

If you have ever taken a course in Algebra, you should have come across the formal definition of a field. In plain English, a field is a set of numbers where the sum and the product of any two numbers are also numbers in the set (*closeness*). Moreover, the set contains the additive and multiplicative identities, which we get when adding or multiplying a number with the corresponding inverse, i.e., $$a + (-a) = 0$$ (*additive identity*) and $$a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$$ (*multiplicative identity*) with $$a \neq 0$$. Finally, it holds that $$a + (b +c) = (a+b) + c$$ (*associativity*), $$a + b = b + a$$ (*commutativity*), and $$a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$$ (*distributivity*). You may remember these five axioms from your Algebra class as they, combined, guarantee the correctness of the arithmetic over real numbers $$\mathbb{R}$$ that we use on a daily basis.

Real numbers, however, are infinite sets and the question here is what if we live in a different world, where we can count only $$p$$ different numbers (let's say the integers $$\mathbb{Z}_p = \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}$$). Does it form a field? How can we do our arithmetic? And before you even object, think first about the device you use to access this article. If you live somewhere between its CPU and RAM, all what you can observe are the numbers $$0$$ and $$1$$ ($$p=2$$). Still, your device can do very sophisticated arithmetic that we, humans, are helpless with. So encountering a world like this is, believe it or not, seemingly possible and we need to figure out how to do arithmetic.

$$ \dots $$

Let's start with addition, if we need to add the numbers $$p-1$$ and $$1$$, you wish to say p but this is impossible because p does not exist. But we agree that whatever this number is it should be a number in the set $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$ if we wish to form a field. A very intuitive solution is to start counting from zero again, i.e., we map $$p$$ to $$0$$, $$p+1$$ to $$1$$ and so on. We can visualize this process with the help of the below cycle on the left

Formally, we say that the set $$\mathbb{Z}_p = \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}$$ forms a cyclic additive group [1]. Adding two numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ means that we start at $$a$$ and move $$b$$ steps counterclockwise or vice versa because of the commutativity of the field. In subtraction we follow the same procedure moving in a clockwise direction. But hold on for a second! We are still missing one important ingredient for making this set look like a field. By now we know that every time we complete a cycle we return back to zero, i.e., $$np=0$$ for any $$n$$. Above that, according to the way we defined the set, $$p$$ is the smallest number that satisfies this criteria, i.e., $$nq \neq 0$$ for all $$q<p$$. But what if we can factorize $$p$$ as $$p=ab$$? If so, we have $$nab=0$$, which implies either $$na=0$$ or $$nb=0$$. Oh no! We contradicted ourselves since $$a,b \leq p$$. The only way to escape this trap is to let $$p$$ be a prime number, and therefore, the only possible factorization is $$p=p \cdot 1$$, which would make us feel relief. So make the proper adjustments to your imaginary world please!!

$$ \dots $$

Before we jump to multiplication, we need to give the above circle a closer look. You don't expect to draw this circle every time you want to execute addition or subtraction, do you? Thankfully there is a more convenient way to do the calculations. Look at the figure carefully and you will figure it out! Yes! Exactly! The remainder. It turns out that all you need to do is to add your numbers as if they are real numbers and then consider the remainder after dividing the resultant by $$p$$:

$$ a+ b = (a+b) \mod p$$

You will hear the mathematicians calling it the modulo-$$p$$ addition but it is nothing but calculating the remainder.
On the other hand, the multiplication rule, if you still haven't guessed it, is same as addition:

$$ a \cdot b = (a \cdot b) \mod p$$

which we refer to as the modulo-$$p$$ multiplication. We also can form a number of cyclic multiplicative subgroups of $$\mathbb{Z}_p^* = \mathbb{Z}_p \setminus \{0\}$$. We exclude zero because multiplying by zero is meh! From this set of the non-zero elements of $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$, we can generate $$p-1$$ cyclic multiplicative subgroups of the form $$\{1, g, g^2, \dots \}$$. We call g the generator of the group and it takes any number in $$\mathbb{Z}_p^*$$, i.e., a number from $$1$$ to $$p-1$$. Let $$p = 7$$, for example, the generator $$g = 1$$ results in a trivial group which is $$\{1\}$$. But when we take $$g = 2$$, more interesting things happen as $$2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4$$, and $$2^3 = 8 \mod 7 = 1$$, which closes the cycle. This forms the cyclic group $$\{1, 2, 4\}$$. With every $$g>1$$, you form a new group as shown in the following figure:

![Crepe](https://almsurely.github.io/assets/img/Galois/Galois1-2.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

A couple of observations can be made from this example. First, we generated subgroups of different lengths (we call it the order of $$g$$), i.e., $$6, 3, 2$$ and $$1$$, and all of these orders divide the cardinality of $$\mathbb{Z}_p^*$$, which is $$6$$. That was proven true for any group by Lagrange's theorem. The second observation is that at least one of these groups are identical to the original set $$\mathbb{Z}_p^*$$. The generator of this specific group (which is $$3$$ and $$5$$ in the above example) is called the primitive element, and we can conclude that the non-zero elements in $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$ form a cyclic multiplicative group. The existence of the primitive element of any group was proven with the help of the Euler's phi function but it is excluded from our discussions to keep it simple.

$$ \dots $$

I have so far showed you how we can do modulo arithmetic over $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$, and hopefully convinced you that $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$ forms a cyclic additive group and $$\mathbb{Z}_p^*$$ forms a cyclic multiplicative group. But I did not show whether we have a field or not. To show this formally we need to prove the five axioms mentioned at the beginning of this article. It should not be hard to prove these axioms-try it yourself. In short, we have constructed a field, and it is usually known as *finite fields* or *Galois fields*.

$$ \dots $$

Well, you do not expect that p numbers are enough to do all the arithmetic you need. What if we need to take the square root of 2 or 3 or whatever? We need to extend the field to include these numbers that we wish to use. That is exactly how we generated the complex numbers $$\mathbb{C}$$---we extended the real numbers $$\mathbb{R}$$ to include one new number, which is $$i$$. We will see how we were able to make these *finite* extensions in the next part. By finite extensions, we mean that the ration between the size of the two fields (before and after the extension) is finite. We don't wish to include all the real numbers for example. You might wonder why not, which is a great question. The answer will though be clear in Part 3, where we find ourselves restricted to the points we can construct using only a ruler and compass.

I will leave you at this point and see you in Part 2!

## Footnotes

[1] The definition of groups is similar to fields but they only take one operation, either addition or multiplication. Therefore, we no longer need the distributivity property. We also drop the commutativity property - It might or might not hold.
