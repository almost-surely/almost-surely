In the last few weeks I was learning and reading about field theory. Despite of its abstraction and dry technicalities, 
I realized that it was crucial in solving some interesting mysteries in Geometry. Have you ever wondered how we can trisect an angle, 
square a circle or double a cube only using an unmarked ruler and a compass? I doubt that anyone would think of any of this but the Greek 
did and never figured it out. It was not until the nineteenth century that we solved these puzzles due to the advent of field theory. 
That is almost over 2000 years of wondering whether it is possible to solve any of these puzzles. So they are not as easy as you might think. 
In this three-part article, I will show you how field theory helped settling these mysteries. In the first two parts I will explain the theoretical 
aspects needed to understand the solution, which you will be introduced to in the last part so bear with me. And to my academic and mathematician 
friends, I am saying hello! And, please, don't get offended!

If you have ever taken a course in Algebra, you should have come across the formal definition of a field. In plain English, a field is a 
set of numbers where the sum and the product of any two numbers are also numbers in the set (closeness). Moreover, the set contains the 
additive and multiplicative identities, which we get when adding or multiplying a number with the corresponding inverse, i.e., $a + (-a) = 0$ 
(additive identity) and $a . a^{-1} = 1$ (multiplicative identity) with $a \neq 0$. Finally, it holds that $a + (b +c) = (a+b) + c$ 
(associativity), $a + b = b + a$ (commutativity), and $a . (b+c) = a . b + a . c$ (distributivity). You may remember these five axioms 
from your Algebra class as they, combined, guarantee the correctness of the arithmetic over real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ that we use on a daily basis.

Real numbers, however, are infinite sets and the question here is what if we live in a different world, where we can count only $p$ 
different numbers (let's say the integers $\mathbb{Z}_p = {0, 1, \dots, p-1}$). Does it form a field? How can we do our arithmetic? And before you even object, 
think first about the device you use to access this article. If you live somewhere between its CPU and RAM, all what you can observe are the 
numbers $0$ and $1$ ($p=2$). Still, your device can do very sophisticated arithmetic that we, humans, are helpless with. So encountering a 
world like this is, believe it or not, seemingly possible and we need to figure out how to do arithmetic.



How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!
